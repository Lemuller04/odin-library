# odin-library

A library made for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)'s [Library](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library) project.

It features a list of books, that can be removed, added, and marked as read.

The table is completely created using DOM manipulation based on an array of Book objects.
